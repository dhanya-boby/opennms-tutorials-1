# Exercise 4-3 

Drools Rules

Before proceeding to [Exercise-4-3](../session4/Exercise-4-3.md), shutdown and clear the database for the EventTranslator project.
```
cd EventTranslator/minimal-minion-activemq
docker compose down -v
```
You should use the docker compose project under the `drools-corellation` folder for this exercise
[session4/drools-correlation/minimal-minion-activemq/](../session4/drools-correlation/minimal-minion-activemq/).


We also looked in [Session 2](../session2/README.md) at how business servicing monitoring can build a graph of services which allows us to determine the business impact of a monitored service failure.
